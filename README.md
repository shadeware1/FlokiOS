# FlokiOS

Overtime I will organize files and package stuff up to make my OS project downloadable. Some info about it for right now:

It is linux based but VERY modified so it is NOT A LINUX OPERATING SYSTEM. The file structure is more similar to windows. It is also GUI focused. It is pretty good for cybersecurity, developing, and some gaming. But it is also good for every day users. It is skeleton at this point, and doesn't have "enterprise" functions. Like read aloud, language changing (only languages Russian & English), etc.
